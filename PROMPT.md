You are implementing a major feature of the Context Engine, a scripting pipeline that uses the Claude Agent SDK to research, plan, and implement plans.

0a. read /home/maceo/Dev/silmari-Context-Engine/thoughts/searchable/shared/plans/2026-01-03-tdd-codewriter5-baml-context-generation-00-overview.md to understand the structure of the specifications

0b. familiarize yourself with the source code in this directory

1. read /home/maceo/Dev/silmari-Context-Engine/thoughts/searchable/shared/plans/2026-01-03-tdd-codewriter5-baml-context-generation-00-overview.md and implement the single highest priority TASK using up to 50 subagents

2. ensure all tests and linting passes, then update /home/maceo/Dev/silmari-Context-Engine/thoughts/searchable/shared/plans/2026-01-03-tdd-codewriter5-baml-context-generation-00-overview.md with your progress

3. use `bd` commands  to commit your changes - do not include any claude attribution

Ensure implementation steps are organized around verifiable milestones, and that you have either a) validated them or b) documented the validation steps or what's not working.
