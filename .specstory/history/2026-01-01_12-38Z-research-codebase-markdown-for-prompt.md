# Research codebase markdown for prompt (2026-01-01 12:38Z)

_**User (2025-12-31 19:27Z)**_

@planning_pipeline/steps.py:28-29 I want to use the text in /home/maceo/Dev/silmari-Context-Engine/.claude/commands/research_codebase.md for this prompt

+ Before starting research:
+ 1. **Check for related issues**: Run &#96;bd list --status=open&#96; to see if there&#39;s already a tracked issue for this topic
+ 2. **Review existing research**: If a beads issue exists, run &#96;bd show &lt;id&gt;&#96; for context - it may reference prior research
+ 
+ After completing research:
+ 1. **Link to existing issues**: If the research relates to tracked work, note the beads issue IDs in your research document
+ 2. **Create issues for discovered work**: If research reveals actionable items (bugs, features, tech debt), optionally create beads issues:
+    &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+    bd create --title=&quot;[Discovered item]&quot; --type=task|bug|feature --priority=2
+    &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 3. **Sync beads**: Run &#96;bd sync&#96; if any issues were created or updated
+ 
+ ## Steps to follow:
+ 
+ 1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**
+    - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first
+    - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
+    - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks
+    - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research
+ 
+ 2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**
+    - Break down the user&#39;s query into composable research areas
+    - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking
+    - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate
+    - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks
+    - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant
+ 
+ 3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**
+    - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently
+    - We now have specialized agents that know how to do specific research tasks:
+ 
+    **For codebase research:**
+    - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find WHERE files and components live
+    - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand HOW specific code works (without critiquing it)
+    - Use the **codebase-pattern-finder** agent to find examples of existing patterns (without evaluating them)
+ 
+    **IMPORTANT**: All agents are documentarians, not critics. They will describe what exists without suggesting improvements or identifying issues.
+ 
+    **For thoughts directory:**
+    - Use the **thoughts-locator** agent to discover what documents exist about the topic
+    - Use the **thoughts-analyzer** agent to extract key insights from specific documents (only the most relevant ones)
+ 
+    **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**
+    - Use the **web-search-researcher** agent for external documentation and resources
+    - IF you use web-research agents, instruct them to return LINKS with their findings, and please INCLUDE those links in your final report
+ 
+    **For Linear tickets (if relevant):**
+    - Use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details of a specific ticket
+    - Use the **linear-searcher** agent to find related tickets or historical context
+ 
+    The key is to use these agents intelligently:
+    - Start with locator agents to find what exists
+    - Then use analyzer agents on the most promising findings to document how they work
+    - Run multiple agents in parallel when they&#39;re searching for different things
+    - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you&#39;re looking for
+    - Don&#39;t write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know
+    - Remind agents they are documenting, not evaluating or improving
+ 
+ 4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**
+    - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding
+    - Compile all sub-agent results (both codebase and thoughts findings)
+    - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth
+    - Use thoughts/ findings as supplementary historical context
+    - Connect findings across different components
+    - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference
+    - Verify all thoughts/ paths are correct (e.g., thoughts/maceo/ not thoughts/shared/ for personal files)
+    - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions
+    - Answer the user&#39;s specific questions with concrete evidence
+ 
+ 5. **Gather metadata for the research document:**
+    - Run the &#96;silmari-oracle metadata&#96; script to generate all relevant metadata
+    - Filename: &#96;thoughts/shared/research/{date_str}-pipeline-research.md&#96;
+      - Format: &#96;YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md&#96; where:
+        - YYYY-MM-DD is today&#39;s date
+        - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)
+        - description is a brief kebab-case description of the research topic
+      - Examples:
+        - With ticket: &#96;2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md&#96;
+        - Without ticket: &#96;2025-01-08-authentication-flow.md&#96;
+ 
+ 6. **Generate research document:**
+    - Use the metadata gathered in step 4
+    - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:
+      &#96;&#96;&#96;markdown

+ 
+      ## Open Questions
+      [Any areas that need further investigation]
+      &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ 7. **Add GitHub permalinks (if applicable):**
+    - Check if on main branch or if commit is pushed: &#96;git branch --show-current&#96; and &#96;git status&#96;
+    - If on main/master or pushed, generate GitHub permalinks:
+      - Get repo info: &#96;gh repo view --json owner,name&#96;
+      - Create permalinks: &#96;https://github.com/{{owner}}/{{repo}}/blob/{{commit}}/{{file}}#L{{line}}&#96;
+    - Replace local file references with permalinks in the document
+ 
+ 8. **Sync and present findings:**
+    
+    - Present a concise summary of findings to the user
+    - Include key file references for easy navigation
+    - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification
+ 
+ 9. **Handle follow-up questions:**
+    - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document
+    - Update the frontmatter fields &#96;last_updated&#96; and &#96;last_updated_by&#96; to reflect the update
+    - Add &#96;last_updated_note: &quot;Added follow-up research for [brief description]&quot;&#96; to frontmatter
+    - Add a new section: &#96;## Follow-up Research [timestamp]&#96;
+    - Spawn new sub-agents as needed for additional investigation
+    - Continue updating the document and syncing
+ 
+ ## Important notes:
+ - Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage
+ - Always run fresh codebase research - never rely solely on existing research documents
+ - The thoughts/ directory provides historical context to supplement live findings
+ - Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference
+ - Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context
+ - Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on read-only documentation operations
+ - Document cross-component connections and how systems interact
+ - Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)
+ - Link to GitHub when possible for permanent references
+ - Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading
+ - Have sub-agents document examples and usage patterns as they exist
+ - Explore all of thoughts/ directory, not just research subdirectory
+ - **CRITICAL**: You and all sub-agents are documentarians, not evaluators
+ - **REMEMBER**: Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE
+ - **NO RECOMMENDATIONS**: Only describe the current state of the codebase
+ - **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks
+ - **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly
+   - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-tasks (step 1)
+   - ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing (step 4)
+   - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 5 before step 6)
+   - NEVER write the research document with placeholder values
+ - **Path handling**: The thoughts/searchable/ directory contains hard links for searching
+   - Always document paths by removing ONLY &quot;searchable/&quot; - preserve all other subdirectories
+   - Examples of correct transformations:
+     - &#96;thoughts/searchable/maceo/old_stuff/notes.md&#96; → &#96;thoughts/maceo/old_stuff/notes.md&#96;
+     - &#96;thoughts/searchable/shared/prs/123.md&#96; → &#96;thoughts/shared/prs/123.md&#96;
+     - &#96;thoughts/searchable/global/shared/templates.md&#96; → &#96;thoughts/global/shared/templates.md&#96;
+   - NEVER change maceo/ to shared/ or vice versa - preserve the exact directory structure
+   - This ensures paths are correct for editing and navigation
+ - **Frontmatter consistency**:
+   - Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents
+   - Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all research documents
+   - Update frontmatter when adding follow-up research
+   - Use snake_case for multi-word field names (e.g., &#96;last_updated&#96;, &#96;git_commit&#96;)
+   - Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied

+ ### 📋 Structure Improvements
+ 
+ - **Better hierarchy** with consistent emoji usage
+ - **Scannable content** with tables and boxes
+ - **Visual separation** between sections
+ - **Professional appearance** while maintaining readability
+ - **Markdown-native** - No external dependencies, works everywhere
+ 
+ ### ✅ Benefits
+ 
+ The enhanced formatting provides:
+ - **Faster scanning** - Visual cues help readers find information quickly
+ - **Better comprehension** - Tables organize complex information clearly
+ - **Professional appearance** - Looks polished and well-organized
+ - **Improved navigation** - Emojis and boxes create visual landmarks
+ - **Maintained simplicity** - Still plain Markdown, no special tools needed
+ 
+ The document should be evisually appealing and easier to navigate while maintaining full Markdown compatibility. All the enhancements MUST use standard Markdown features (tables, HTML, code blocks, emojis) that render correctly in GitHub, VS Code, and other Markdown viewers.
+ 
+ After creating the document, output the path.

Replaced the prompt in `steps.py` with the content from `research_codebase.md`. The new prompt:

1. **Includes the research question** at the top using the `{research_prompt}` variable
2. **Uses the date variable** for the filename: `thoughts/shared/research/{date_str}-pipeline-research.md`
3. **Contains all the detailed instructions** from the markdown file, including:
   - Critical documentation guidelines
   - Beads integration steps
   - Step-by-step research process
   - Sub-agent usage instructions
   - Document structure and formatting guidelines
   - Enhanced formatting recommendations

The prompt is now a comprehensive research guide that will be used when the `step_research` function is called. No linting errors were introduced.

Updated the code to read the markdown file at runtime instead of embedding it. The implementation:

1. **Reads the file** from `.claude/commands/research_codebase.md` at runtime
2. **Inserts the research question** after the "# Research Codebase" title
3. **Removes the "Initial Setup" section** (for interactive use only)
4. **Replaces date placeholders** in the filename instructions with the actual date
5. **Adds the final instruction** about outputting the path

This keeps the code maintainable: updating the markdown file updates the prompt without changing the Python code. No linting errors were introduced.

Updated the planning step to read the markdown file at runtime. The implementation:

1. **Reads the file** from `.claude/commands/create_tdd_plan.md` at runtime
2. **Inserts the research document path** and additional context (if provided) after the "# TDD Implementation Plan" title
3. **Removes the "Initial Response" section** (for interactive use only)
4. **Replaces date placeholders** in the filename instructions with the actual date
5. **Adds the final instruction** about outputting the path

This keeps the code maintainable: updating the markdown file updates the prompt without changing the Python code. No linting errors were introduced.

+ 
+ ### 9. Resume a Failed Pipeline
+ 
+ When a pipeline fails, you can resume from the last successful step using the individual step functions. Here&#39;s how to resume from each failure point:
+ 
+ #### Resume from Research Failure
+ 
+ If research failed, simply re-run it:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;python
+ from pathlib import Path
+ from planning_pipeline import step_research
+ 
+ project_path = Path.cwd()
+ research = step_research(project_path, &quot;Your research question here&quot;)
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### Resume from Planning Failure
+ 
+ If planning failed but research succeeded, use the research path:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;python
+ from pathlib import Path
+ from planning_pipeline import step_planning, step_phase_decomposition, step_beads_integration
+ 
+ project_path = Path.cwd()
+ 
+ # Use the research path from the failed run
+ research_path = &quot;thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-31-your-research.md&quot;
+ 
+ # Resume from planning
+ plan = step_planning(project_path, research_path)
+ if plan[&quot;success&quot;]:
+     # Continue with remaining steps
+     phases = step_phase_decomposition(project_path, plan[&quot;plan_path&quot;])
+     beads = step_beads_integration(project_path, phases[&quot;phase_files&quot;], &quot;My Epic&quot;)
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### Resume from Phase Decomposition Failure
+ 
+ If decomposition failed but planning succeeded:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;python
+ from pathlib import Path
+ from planning_pipeline import step_phase_decomposition, step_beads_integration
+ 
+ project_path = Path.cwd()
+ 
+ # Use the plan path from the failed run
+ plan_path = &quot;thoughts/shared/plans/2025-12-31-plan.md&quot;
+ 
+ # Resume from decomposition
+ phases = step_phase_decomposition(project_path, plan_path)
+ if phases[&quot;success&quot;]:
+     # Continue with beads integration
+     beads = step_beads_integration(project_path, phases[&quot;phase_files&quot;], &quot;My Epic&quot;)
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### Resume from Beads Integration Failure
+ 
+ If beads integration failed but decomposition succeeded:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;python
+ from pathlib import Path
+ from planning_pipeline import step_beads_integration
+ 
+ project_path = Path.cwd()
+ 
+ # Use the phase files from the failed run
+ phase_files = [
+     &quot;thoughts/shared/plans/2025-12-31/00-overview.md&quot;,
+     &quot;thoughts/shared/plans/2025-12-31/01-phase-1-setup.md&quot;,
+     # ... other phase files
+ ]
+ 
+ # Resume from beads integration
+ beads = step_beads_integration(project_path, phase_files, &quot;My Epic&quot;)
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### Complete Resume Example Script
+ 
+ Here&#39;s a complete script you can save and run from the command line to resume a pipeline:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;python
+ #!/usr/bin/env python3

Added a section on resuming a failed pipeline. It includes:

1. **Resume examples for each failure point**:
   - Research failure: re-run `step_research`
   - Planning failure: use the research path to continue
   - Decomposition failure: use the plan path to continue
   - Beads integration failure: use the phase files to continue

2. **A complete resume script** you can save and run from the command line

3. **Command-line usage examples** showing how to resume using Python one-liners or a script

**Quick example to resume from planning:**

```bash
python3 -c "
from pathlib import Path
from planning_pipeline import step_planning, step_phase_decomposition, step_beads_integration

project_path = Path.cwd()
research_path = 'thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-31-your-research.md'  # Update with your path

plan = step_planning(project_path, research_path)
if plan['success']:
    phases = step_phase_decomposition(project_path, plan['plan_path'])
    if phases['success']:
        beads = step_beads_integration(project_path, phases['phase_files'], 'My Epic')
"
```

The key is using the paths from previous successful steps as inputs to the next step. The documentation now includes examples for each failure scenario.

when I paste in the python from Resume from Planning Failure the CLI prompt is if> since the if is not completed

Updated the documentation to avoid the `if>` prompt issue. Changes:

1. **All examples now use script files** — Created with `cat > script.py << 'EOF'` so you can copy and run them without the `if>` prompt.

2. **Removed problematic `python3 -c` examples** — These caused issues when pasting multi-line code with `if` statements.

3. **Added clear CLI-friendly examples** — Each resume scenario shows how to create a script file you can run directly.

**Quick example for resuming from planning:**

```bash
cat > resume_planning.py << 'EOF'
from pathlib import Path
from planning_pipeline import step_planning, step_phase_decomposition, step_beads_integration

project_path = Path.cwd()
research_path = "/home/maceo/Dev/silmari-Context-Engine/thoughts/shared/research/2026-01-01-baml-integration-research.md"

plan = step_planning(project_path, research_path)
if plan["success"]:
    phases = step_phase_decomposition(project_path, plan["plan_path"])
    if phases["success"]:
        beads = step_beads_integration(project_path, phases["phase_files"], "My Epic")
        print(f"✓ Completed: Epic ID {beads.get('epic_id')}")
EOF

python3 resume_planning.py
```

This avoids the `if>` prompt because the code is in a complete script file, not pasted into an interactive Python shell.

Fixed the argument parsing. The script wasn't parsing command-line arguments. It now uses `argparse` to handle them.

**Note:** Use hyphens (`--research-path`) instead of underscores (`--research_path`) on the command line. argparse converts hyphens to underscores internally.

Your command should be:

```bash
python3 resume_pipeline.py planning --research-path thoughts/shared/research/2026-01-01-baml-integration-research.md
```

The script now:
- Parses all command-line arguments
- Validates required arguments for each step
- Provides helpful error messages if arguments are missing
- Shows usage examples with `--help`

You can also run:
```bash
python3 resume_pipeline.py --help
```

This shows all available options and examples for each step.
