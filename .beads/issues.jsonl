{"id":"silmari-Context-Engine-02ve","title":"Output ordering issue: progress indicators appear after Claude completes","description":"The Go runtime prints progress messages like '[6/7] Expanding...' AFTER Claude has already completed and printed its output. This causes confusing output where the JSON result appears before the progress indicator for that step.\n\nRoot cause: Progress message at decomposition.go:140 is printed on main thread BEFORE calling RunClaudeSync() at line 152, but the final debug message 'Output captured' at claude_runner.go:209 appears in stderr BEFORE control returns to the main thread to print the NEXT progress message.\n\nThe timing shows:\n1. Step N completes, Claude prints 'Output captured' debug message\n2. Main thread prints '[N+1/7] Expanding...' progress message\n3. Step N+1 starts executing\n\nThis creates the illusion that output is interleaved, but it's actually sequential with debug messages appearing between natural breakpoints.\n\nExpected behavior: Progress indicators should appear BEFORE each Claude invocation's output, not after.\n\nImpact: Low severity - functional but confusing for users watching the output.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-10T14:38:07.20699851-05:00","created_by":"maceo","updated_at":"2026-01-10T14:38:07.20699851-05:00"}

Resume pipeline from failed phase using partial execution\n\n## Technical Details\n- Checkpoint infrastructure exists and is fully functional (`go/internal/planning/checkpoint.go`)\n- Missing: Integration in `runOrchestrator()` function (`go/internal/cli/orchestrator.go:46-113`)\n- Missing: Partial pipeline execution in `PlanningPipeline.Run()` (`go/internal/planning/pipeline.go`)\n\n## Reference Implementations\n- Python planning orchestrator: `planning_orchestrator.py:296-417` (handle_resume_flow)\n- Python step execution: `planning_orchestrator.py:455-591` (execute_from_step)\n- Python RLM-Act resume: `silmari_rlm_act/cli.py:188-252`\n\n## Reproduction\n1.

{"id":"silmari-Context-Engine-nm7t","title":"Race condition in Go Claude output streaming causes lost terminal output","description":"CRITICAL FINDING: Claude CLI --print mode is CRASHING, not hanging\n\nROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:\nThe Claude CLI crashes with 'Maximum call stack size exceeded' (Node.js RangeError) when run in --print mode. This is an infinite recursion bug in Claude CLI itself, not an issue with the Go code.\n\nEvidence from /tmp/claude/.../ba6eb44.output:\n```\nnode:internal/async_hooks:192\nfunction emitInitNative(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId, resource) {\n                       ^\nRangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\n```\n\nThis explains why:\n- Claude process starts but never produces output\n- Happens with ANY prompt (even 'test')\n- Happens regardless of stdin vs -p flag\n- Happens in any directory\n- Happens with --dangerously-skip-permissions\n\nIMPACT:\nThe Go implementation CANNOT work until Claude CLI --print is fixed. All the Go code fixes (race condition, stdin approach) are correct but irrelevant while Claude CLI is broken.\n\nGO CODE STATUS:\n✅ Race condition fixed (WaitGroup synchronization)\n✅ Stdin approach implemented correctly\n✅ Debug logging added\n✅ Both streaming and non-streaming modes fixed\n\nCLAUDE CLI STATUS:\n❌ --print mode crashes immediately\n❌ Bug is in Claude Code Node.js runtime\n❌ Affects ALL --print usage, not just context-engine\n\nWORKAROUND:\nUse Python planning_pipeline directly:\n```bash\npython planning_pipeline/planning_orchestrator.py --research-path thoughts/searchable/research/2026-01-09-building-writing-agent-ui.md --prompt-text \"Create plan\" --resume-step planning\n```\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n1. Use Python pipeline (works perfectly)\n2. File bug with Claude Code: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues\n3. Revisit Go implementation after Claude CLI is fixed\n4. Consider Go implementation may need different approach (direct API calls instead of CLI wrapper)\n\nFILES MODIFIED (all correct but blocked by CLI bug):\n- go/internal/planning/claude_runner.go: Fixed race condition, added stdin support, debug logging\n\nTESTING ENVIRONMENT:\n- Node.js: v20.19.4\n- Claude CLI: (check with: claude --version)\n- OS: Linux WSL2","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-09T14:02:48.345449414-05:00","created_by":"maceo","updated_at":"2026-01-10T10:12:55.622627055-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-10T10:12:55.622649355-05:00"}
